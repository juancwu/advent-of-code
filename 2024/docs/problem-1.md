## Notes

Look for the locations to search

Have access to:

- Location ID

Example Input:

```
3 4
4 3
2 5
1 3
3 9
3 3
```

Pair up the numbers

- smallest number in the left list with smallest number in the right list
- basically sorting

Keep track of the distance between a pair,
and add the distances together.

Question: What is the total distance betwen the lists?
